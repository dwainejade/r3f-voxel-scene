VERIFICATION STEPS - DO THESE NOW
===================================

1. HARD REFRESH THE BROWSER (this is critical)
   - macOS: Cmd + Shift + R
   - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + F5

   This will clear the browser cache and load fresh code from the dev server.

2. Open DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Clear any existing logs with the 'X' button

3. Click ONCE in the canvas to place a voxel

4. LOOK FOR THESE EXACT LOGS (in this order):
   ✓ === CLICK HANDLER ===
   ✓ planeMode: "y", planePosition: 0
   ✓ ray direction: (some numbers)
   ✓ Y Plane click: t=something, calculated (x, y, z)
   ✓ setVoxel: requested (x, y, z) -> clamped (x, y, z)
   ✓ Placed voxel at (x, y, z) in chunk (cx, cy, cz)

5. IF YOU SEE OLD LOGS LIKE:
   ✗ "No hit - placing voxel at origin"
   ✗ "Voxel set at world (0,0,0)"
   ✗ "Chunk now has 1 voxels"

   THEN:
   a) Close the browser tab completely
   b) Close the entire browser application
   c) Reopen the browser
   d) Navigate to http://localhost:5173
   e) Do hard refresh again (Cmd+Shift+R)
   f) Try clicking again

   OR use Incognito/Private mode to completely bypass browser cache.

WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:
====================
- Click center of canvas: voxel at (0, 0, 0)
- Click top-left of canvas: voxel at (negative_x, 0, positive_z)
- Click top-right of canvas: voxel at (positive_x, 0, positive_z)
- Click bottom-left: voxel at (negative_x, 0, negative_z)
- Click bottom-right: voxel at (positive_x, 0, negative_z)

All coordinates should snap to the 10x10x10 grid (-5 to 5 range).

DEV SERVER STATUS:
==================
Dev server is running at http://localhost:5173
The new code with plane intersection is compiled and ready.
Just need the browser to load it fresh.
